				"note": `Uptown Radio is part of Uptown Theater, famous venue along the renowned Chitlin Circuit
								where all of the famous acts such as Sarah Vaughan, the Jackson 5, Georgie Woods, Red Fox 
								and plenty others would come and perform. Segregation prohibited these performers from playing
								at the cross town venues so they would come to venues like Uptown Theater in Philly for the 
								people to enjoy. In 2017, Linda Richardson spearheaded the Uptown Theater Restoration Project
								to bring the theater back, due date 2023. Recently, Mrs. Richardson passed on though her work 
								continues. If you're in Philly and want to hear some great music check out Uptown Radio WJYN 98.5 FM
								 and be sure to see them in the upcoming documentary film 'WVOE: the Voice of Ebony'.`,
